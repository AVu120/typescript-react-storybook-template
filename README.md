## Contribute to Storybook.

1. Increment the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) in the package.json file to reflect the changes you have made.
2. Create a pull-request (PR) to merge your feature branch into master.
3. Have relevant stakeholders inspect code/DOM/component/visual/story changes in the Chromatic PR preview environment.
4. After all changes have been approved in Chromatic & the PR has been approved on GitHub, merge & squash the PR into master.

- On the completion of step 4, a new npm package containing your changes will be published to this repository's GitHub Packages.
- The updated Storybook will also be deployed to the live QA environment.
